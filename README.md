# Data

This repository contains the computational data for the lithiation of (001)-Surface of an alpha-S8 cathode sytem through three lithiation steps. It includes optimized geometries and total energies for each lithiation step, as well as the input files, basis sets, and potential files used for the calculations. This data is provided to enable reproducibility and further analysis of the lithiation process.
